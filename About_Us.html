  <h2>Our History</h2>
  <p>
    Located in Nowheresville, Precious pizza was first conceptualised by its creators Leonardo and Sofia Russo. Leonardo and Sofia are Italian immigrants, moving to the United States 1994 to start their business of authentic and traditional Italian style pizza
  </p>
  <p>
    Leonardo and Sofia arrived with their son Elio when they were 34 years old. After 30 years of operation, Leonardo and Sofia are no longer the owners of precious Pizza.
  </p>
  <p>
    The restaurant that started as a family business is still in the family with Elio at the reins in 2022. Since then, the shop has become more modern but still with an unmistakable old world Italian feel that the populace fell in love with originally. As said by Elio “We need to move ahead into the modern era without pushing away our current loyal clientele.”
